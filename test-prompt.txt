Create a CodeSkill that can generate, compile, test, and register new Go-based skills.

The CodeSkill should:
- Accept natural language descriptions of desired skills
- Generate complete Go source code with proper package declaration, imports, main function
- Include basic error handling and follow security best practices  
- Use only standard library when possible
- Generate binaries that read from stdin and write to stdout
- Handle JSON messaging envelopes for inter-skill communication
- Include basic unit tests when appropriate

The generated skill should be named "CodeSkill" with binary name "codeskill".
